# practice-counting-cards
This is a React app that I built that helps practice counting cards. The main component is `src/component/WhatsTheCount`. In `src/modules` there is a file called `deckUtils.js` that exports a function called `makeShoe`. That builds and shuffles the deck of cards the app uses. Running `npm install` and then `npm run dev` should start the app.
